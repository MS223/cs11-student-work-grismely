class Pet(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

my_pet = Pet("Nymeria")
print my_pet.name
#1. __init__ most likely sets up something
#2. If you wanted to initialize all pet objects with a name and color you'd be giving them this value before hand
#3.You would most likely need to add the parameter 'color' to the function and then give it a value when defining the varibale 'my_pet'
